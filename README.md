# EtsySearcher

 * No JavaScript library is used as required. Used bootstrap css for better view.
 * Tried in firefox 45, Chrome 50 and Microsoft Edge 25. All seem to work
 * Put your api key in line 2 of [etsy.js](https://github.com/needforspeed/EtsySearcher/blob/master/etsy.js#L2), then you can run this in apache http or nginx server or whatever you choose like http-server.
